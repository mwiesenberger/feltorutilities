# Utilities for feltor simulations

The goal of this package is to provide utilities for the setup and run
 of 3d feltor simulations.

It consists of
 - The python module `feltorutilities` contains parameter functions and methods to
convert from physical to numerical parameters and back.
 - Jupyter notebooks guiding the generation of suitable input parameters for both the feltor and the thermal feltor codes.

## Installation
### Feltorutilities python module
The python package `feltorutilities` can be locally installed via
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mwiesenberger/feltorutilities
cd feltorutilities
pip install -e .
```

### Feltorutilities jupyter notebooks
The notebooks depend on the `pandas` and `numpy` packages and the `simplesimdb` and `pyfeltor` module.
The other dependency is the [Feltor](https://github.com/feltor-dev/feltor) code repository.
Follow the quick-start guide to install.
It is recommended to keep Feltor and this repository next to each other.
If not, you will need to set the `FELTOR_PATH` environment variable in order for
`feltor.sh`, `job.sh` and `feltordiag.sh` to work.

Lastly, we need jupyter to run the notebooks.

## Usage
### Feltorutilities python module

#### Plasma formulary
First, a list of plasma formulas is provided. These functions can be called as
```python
import feltorutilities as fp
fp.rho_s( B_0, m_i, T_e)
# or
parameters = {"B_0" : 0.7, "m_i" : fp.deuteron_mass, "T_e" : 0.07}
fp.rho_s( **parameters)
```
To get a list of available functions type

```python
function_names = fp.quantities()
```

A utility function is provided that lets you compute a collection of quantities
from given parameters at once, e.g.

```python
parameters = {"B_0" : 0.7, "m_i" : fp.deuteron_mass, "T_e" : 0.07}
values = parameters2quantities( parameters, ["rho_s", "c_s", "omega_0_inv"])
```

#### Invert numerical parameters
Second we provide a utility function that inverts given numerical parameters
back to the corresponding physical ones. This is useful in analysing
simulation data where only the numerical values are stored.
For example:
```python
physical = {"R" : 0.6}
numerical = {"mu" : -2.72e-4,"tau":1,"beta":4.11e-4,"resistivity" : 3.81e-5,"R_0" : 91.94}
numerical2physical( numerical, physical)
# now physical contains R, m_i, T_e, n_0, B_0, T_i)
```

### Feltorutilities simulation setup jupyter notebooks
This package contains two folders `feltor` and `thermal` that are intended to serve as templates to start your own project for the corresponding feltor codes.
In order to setup a Feltor simulation you need to
 - First, decide if you want to run a isothermal, 2-species Feltor simulation  or a thermal, multispecies simulation. In the first case copy the `feltor` folder to a new repository, in the second one use the `thermal` folder
 - If necessary adapt the `FELTOR_PATH` variable in all `*.sh` files.
 - Run the jupyter notebook in the folder and follow the instructions in the file
```bash
jupyter-lab
```
 - Once you generated satisfactory input parameters, either manually copy them or load them in the `generate_data.py` script. The idea for this script is to automatically generate submit scripts on a HPC cluster such that the simulation is automatically restarted if necessary and/or parameter studies are possible.
